  <p>Dear {{candidatename}},</p>
<p>As a member of <i>The Big Issue</i> Activist Army, and as my local candidate, I need your help.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23activistarmy">We’ve been working</a> to put <b>poverty prevention</b> at the heart of this election. <a href="http://www.bigissue.com/news/big-issues-prevention-manifesto">Our manifesto is clear.</a> With <a href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/press/half-million-rise-number-people-poverty-shows-britain-isnt-working-everyone">14 million</a> people living in poverty - and the failure to deal with the effects of poverty costing <a href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/press/poverty-costs-uk-78-billion-year">£78 billion</a> a year - prevention should be at the heart of every policy when it comes to poverty.</p>
<p><strong>With just days to go to 8 June, we’re calling on you - and every other candidate, and every party leader - to endorse the plan for a Prevention Unit.</strong></p>
<p>Political parties are listening. <a href="http://www.bigissue.com/tag/general-election-2017">They’re answering our call</a> and weaving prevention into their proposals. But we want them to go further. We want to see cross-party commitments to take prevention seriously. <strong><a href="">We want them to create a Prevention Unit</a> to fix poverty at the top of the agenda for good.</strong></p>
<p>A top-level taskforce at the centre of government with a vital mission: to find out what works, and what needs to change, to dismantle the roots of poverty. A hub for ideas, a bridge across departments, and a watchful eye, checking that policies offer a hand-up out of poverty.</p>
<p>Your backing is vital. A public endorsement that you’re backing the Prevention Unit will spark a groundswell of support. Social media is easiest, as below, but if you don’t use Twitter or Facebook, let me know and I’ll pass on the message to <i>The Big Issue</i>:</p>
<p><strong>I'm with @BigIssue #ActivistArmy: a Prevention Unit would keep poverty at the top of the agenda - are you on board? [bit.ly/xxxxxxx]</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration. It'd be great to have you on side.</p>
